#Kickstarter Analysis

##Project Overview

Our client, Louise, has tasked us with aiding her in raising funds for a new theater production of hers. She is wanting to take a closer look at the data Kickstarter has for various productions over the course of different times frames and different goals set upon these productions. This data set is to assist Louise at making decisions that will lead her to successful campaign and fund raising goal for her new production.


##Analysis and Challenges

To get the data set we desire, we needed to first filter out any unnecessary information. We needed to narrow it down to “Theater”, and then to “plays” to get a better look at the monetary goals and the time frame of when those projects launched. From there, we can begin looking at what projects have succeeded and failed. And from those numbers we can calculate the percentage of their respective success and or failed rates. Once we’ve sorted out the information, we set out break it down to specific data sets. One based on goal fundings and one based on date launched. The goal was to set out when was the best time to begin a Kickstarter fundraiser and a clear understanding of monetary goals.

Kickstarter included data that had to be converted into more readable information for our purposes. The data for “Deadlines” and “Launched Date” had to be converted to readable dates.


###Outcomes based on Goals

To get a clear understanding of the monetary goals, we needed to create a table of various financial ranges beginning with less than $1000, and then increasing increments of $5000 up towards of Greater than $50,000. Then we take these ranges and sort them out from how many projects have Failed, Succeeded, and Cancelled. Once we’ve received that information, we were then able to take the TOTAL amount of projects for each range and calculate a percentage for “success”, “failed”, and “cancelled”. The potential challenge here is coming up with the proper formulaic code in excel to make sure you have the right amount of projects in each of their respective cells. one of the issues i was running into was making sure that the right amount of projects were in their respective cell. So sometimes I had to go back and filter the info to make sure my values and information were correct.


###Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Timing is everything and we need to be able to know when is an ideal time to launch a fundraiser for a play for Louise. We take the information from the “Success”, “Failed”, and “Cancelled” projects and put in a chart that reflected based on date launched. One of the challenges here is not being aware of extra information being added to fields when you want to display certain information in your tables. 


##Results

##Theater Outcomes by Launched Date

Based on the results in the graph, we can see that the best time to launch a successful campaign is during either May or June. May has a better chance of succeeding and based on the information from our table, the highest activities of fundraising for plays is during the months May through August. 


##Theater Outcomes based on Goals

Based on the data we have been able to sort, lower monetary goals have a higher success rate. such as around $5000. The higher you set, the more likely your project will fail. this does not hold true for some  high goals, but tat data set is much smaller. If Louise wishes to have a successful campaign for her new production, a goal of $5000 with a launch date of May would yield her a very successful campaign.
